/// A property wrapper to mark a property as one that is indexable by a data store.
///
/// Indexable properties must be ``/Swift/Codable`` so that their values can be encoded and decoded,
/// and be ``/Swift/Comparable`` so that a stable order may be formed when saving to a data store.
///
/// To mark a property as one that an index should be built against, mark it as such:
///
///     struct MyStruct {
///         var id: UUID
///
///         @Indexed
///         var name: String
///
///         @Indexed
///         var age: Int = 1
///
///         var other: [Int] = []
///
///         //@Indexed
///         //var nonCodable = NonCodable() // Not allowed!
///
///         //@Indexed
///         //var nonComparable = NonComparable() // Not allowed!
///     }
///
/// - Note: The `id` field from ``/Foundation/Identifiable`` does not need to be indexed, as it is indexed by default for instance uniqueness in a data store.
///
/// - Warning: Although changing which properties are indexed, including their names and types, is fully supported,
/// changing the ``/Swift/Comparable`` implementation of a type between builds can lead to problems. If ``/Swift/Comparable``
/// conformance changes, you should declare a new version along side it so you can force an index to be migrated at the same time.
///
/// > Attention:
/// > Only use this type as a property wrapper. Marking a computed property as returning an ``Indexed`` field is not supported, and will fail at runtime.
/// >
/// > This is because the index won't be properly detected when warming up a datastore and won't properly
/// migrate indices as a result of that failed detection:
